# Battleship
This is a game of Battleship played over a network.
The game can be executed on a Raspberry pi with a 4 x 8 Unicorn pHAT or in a terminal.

## Instructions
To run this game on a Raspberry Pi with a Unicorn pHAT the script must be run as root and the [unicorn-hat](https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat) package installed .

Execute the `main.py` to start the game.

The script can take the `--host` flag to run as the host or `--client=<ip>` to connect to the host.

The script can also take `--ai` to run the AI implementation as the player.

To run the game on the Raspberry Pi with a unicorn pHAT no other flags should be provided.

To run the game in terminal run with `--display` or in an environment without unicornhat.

To run a game without a display, useful when playing against the AI, run with `--no-display`.

The default port is 5000 but can be changed by providing a number to `--port=<port nr>`
